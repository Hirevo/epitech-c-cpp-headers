# EPITECH C/C++ Headers

This is a handler for EPITECH headers in C/C++ projects.
It can create them and updates them automatically.

[Link to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace extension page.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicolaspolomack.epitech-c-cpp-headers)

## Features

You can create a header for a new file by:
- Using the `epitech-c-cpp-headers.addHeader` command
- Pressing `ctrl+shift+h` (`cmd+shift+h` on macOS)

Each time you save a C or C++ file with a header, it will update it automatically.

You can configure the headers in a very simple manner by executing the `epitech-c-cpp-headers.setConfig` command.  
By default, it will execute it on launch when a configuration field is left unknown.

## Requirements

No dependancies

## Extension Settings

This extension uses the following configuration entries:

* `epitech-c-cpp-headers.username`: Specify the username to use in headers (default: null)
* `epitech-c-cpp-headers.login`: Specify the login to use in headers (default: null)
* `epitech-c-cpp-headers.prompt`: Specify if the extension should prompt for unknown configuration fields (default: true)
* `epitech-c-cpp-headers.usePragmaOnce`: Specifies if '#pragma once' should be used as header guard instead of '#ifndef ...' (default: false)
* `epitech-c-cpp-headers.autoGenerateClasses`: Specifies if automatic C++ class generation is enabled (default: true)

## Known Issues
