This is a handler for EPITECH headers in C/C++ projects.
It can create them and updates them automatically.

[Link to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace extension page.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicolaspolomack.epitech-c-cpp-headers)

Features
--------

You can create a header for a new file by:

- Using the `epitech-c-cpp-headers.addHeader` command
- Pressing `ctrl+shift+h` (`cmd+shift+h` on macOS)

Each time you save a C or C++ file with a header, it will update it automatically.

You can configure the headers in a very simple manner by executing the `epitech-c-cpp-headers.setConfig` command.
By default, it will execute it on launch when a configuration field is left unknown.

It is also possible to replace the regular Epitech header with a custom one by setting the `epitech-c-cpp-headers.customHeader` configuration field.

```json
{
    "epitech-c-cpp-headers.customHeader": [
        "HEADER LINE 1",
        "HEADER LINE 2",
        "HEADER LINE 3",
        "..."
    ]
}
```

Requirements
------------

No dependancies

- `epitech-c-cpp-headers.login`: Specify the login to use in headers (default: null)
- `epitech-c-cpp-headers.prompt`: Specify if the extension should prompt for unknown configuration fields (default: true)
- `epitech-c-cpp-headers.usePragmaOnce`: Specifies if '#pragma once' should be used as header guard instead of '#ifndef ...' (default: false)
- `epitech-c-cpp-headers.autoGenerateClasses`: Specifies if automatic C++ class generation is enabled (default: true)
